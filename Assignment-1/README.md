### Assignment-1

- While diving into the world of WebGL and its countless applications across the web, I discovered its use in rendering shaders for fractals. Iâ€™ve always found fractals fascinating, ever since I first saw a snowflake and realized that its beautiful pattern is actually replicated over and over again.
- Fractals appear in many parts of nature, and I was amazed to see them represented through WebGL and three.js. One example is a fractal discovered by Barry Martin, known as the Hopalong Attractor, which is defined by the following simple formula: `(x, y) -> (y - sign(x)*sqrt(abs(b*x - c)), a - x)`.
- This formula uses three variables to plot random dots on a graph according to specific rules. Repeating this process over and over creates remarkable patterns. It reminds me of my old Macintosh sleep screen, which probably used an attractor very similar to this!
