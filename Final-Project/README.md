## ⚙️ Final Project Proposal:

### 3D Data Visualization Dashboard for Hyperspectral Data

### Project Overview
This project involves creating an interactive 3D Data Visualization Dashboard to visualize hyperspectral datasets. This tool will enable users to upload hyperspectral data and explore it in a 3D environment. 

Visualization will include:

- **Geometric Objects**: Includes volume elements for spectral visualization and an external model loaded from a GLTF file.
- **Animations**: Animations such as rotations, translations, and changes to visualization parameters.
- **Texture Mapping**: Texture mapping to highlight spectral bands.
